php-linode-unofficial
===================


This is just a little wrapper I'm working on to ease the testing of the Linode API v4. If
you think something is done incorrectly or dumb please feel free to open an issue or
contribute. I am in no way an expert and have never written one of these before.

> - I don't care if you don't like PHP. Use something else.
